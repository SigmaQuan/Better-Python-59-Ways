# Item 5: Know how to slice sequences


# Python includes syntax for slicing sequences into pieces. Slicing lets you
# access a subset of a sequence's items with minimal effort. The simplest uses
# for slicing are the built-in types list, str, and bytes. Slicing can be
# extended to any Python class that implements the __getitem__ and __setitem__
# special methods (see Item 28: Inherit form collections.abc for custom
# container types).

# The basic form of the slicing syntax is somelist[start:end], where start is
# inclusive and end is exclusive.


a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
print('First four: ', a[:4])
print('Last four:  ', a[-4:])
print('Middle two: ', a[3:-3])
# First four:  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# Last four:   ['e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
# Middle two:  ['d', 'e']


# When slicing from the start of a list, you should leave out the zero index
# to reduce visual noise.


assert a[:5] == a[0:5]


# When slicing to the end of a list, you should leave out the final index
# because it's redundant.


assert a[5:] == a[5:len(a)]


# Using negative numbers for slicing is helpful for doing offsets relative
# to the end of a list. All of these forms of slicing would be clear to a new
# reader of your code. There are no surprises, and I encourage you to use
# these variations.


print(a[:])
print(a[:5])
print(a[:-1])
print(a[4:])
print(a[-3:])
print(a[2:5])
print(a[2:-1])
print(a[-3:-1])
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
# ['e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
# ['f', 'g', 'h']
# ['c', 'd', 'e']
# ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
# ['f', 'g']


# Slicing deals properly with start and end indexes that are beyond the
# boundaries of the list. That makes it easy for your code to establish
# a maximum length to consider for an input sequence.


first_twenty_items = a[:20]
last_twenty_items = a[-20:]
print(first_twenty_items)
print(last_twenty_items)
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']


# In contrast, accessing the same index directly causes an exception.
# print(a[20])
# IndexError: list index out of range


# Note
# Beware that indexing a list by a negative variable is one of the few
# situations in which you can get surprising results from slicing. For
# example, the expression somelist[-n:] will work fine when n is greater
# than one (e.g. somelist[-3:]). However, when n is zero, the expression
# somelist[-0:] will result in a copy of the original list.


# The result of slicing a list is a whole new list. References to the objects
# from the original list are maintained. Modifying the result of slicing won't
# affect the original list.


b = a[4:]
print('Before:    ', b)
b[1] = 99
print('After:     ', b)
print('No change: ', a)
# Before:     ['e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
# After:      ['e', 99, 'g', 'h']
# No change:  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']


# When used in assignments, slices will replace the specified range in the
# original list. Unlike tuple assignments (like a, b = c[:2), the length of
# slice assignments don't need to be the same. The values before and after
# the assigned slice will be preserved. The list will grow or shrink to
# accommodate the new values.


print('Before: ', a)
a[2:7] = [99, 22, 14]
print('After:  ', a)
# Before:  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
# After:   ['a', 'b', 99, 22, 14, 'h']


# If you leave out both the start and the end indexes when slicing, you'll end
# up with a copy of the original list.


b = a[:]
assert b == a and b is not a


# if you assign a slice with no start or end indexes, you'll replace its
# entire contents with a copy of what's referenced (instead of allocating a
# new list).


b = a
print('Before: ', a)
a[:] = [101, 102, 103]
assert a is b
print('After:  ', a)
# Before:  ['a', 'b', 99, 22, 14, 'h']
# After:   [101, 102, 103]


# Things to remember

# 1. Avoid being verbose: Don't supply 0 for the start index or the length of
#     the sequence for the end index.
# 2. Slicing is forgiving of start or end indexes that are out of bounds,
#     making it easy to express slices on the front or back boundaries of a
#     sequence (like a[:20] or a[-20:]).
# 3. Assigning to a list slice will replace that range in the original
#     sequence with what's referenced even if their lengths are different.
