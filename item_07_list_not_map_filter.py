# Item 7: Use list comprehensions instead of map and filter


# Python provides compact syntax for deriving one list from another. These
# expressions are called list comprehensions. For example, say you want to
# compute the square of each number in a list. You can do this by providing
# the expression for your computation and the input sequence to loop over.


a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
squares = [x**2 for x in a]
print(squares)
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]


# Unless you're applying a single-argument functions, list comprehensions are
# clearer than map built-in function cases, map requires creating a lambda
# function for the computation, which is visually noisy.


squares = map(lambda x: x**2, a)
print(squares)
# Python 2
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
# Python 3
print(list(squares))
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]


# Unlike map, list comprehensions let you easily filter items from the input
# list, removing corresponding outputs from the result. For example, say you
# only want to compute the squares of the numbers that are divisible by 2.
# Here, I do this by adding a conditional expression to the list
# comprehension after the loop:


even_squares = [x**2 for x in a if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)
# [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]


# The filter built-in function can be used along with map to achieve the same
# outcome, but it is much harder to read.


alt = map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, a))
assert even_squares == list(alt)


# Dictionaries and sets have their own equivalents of list comprehensions.
# These make it easy to create derivative data structures when writing
# algorithms.


chile_ranks = {'ghost': 1, 'habanero': 2, 'cayenne': 3}
rank_dict = {rank: name for name, rank in chile_ranks.items()}
chile_len_set = {len(name) for name in rank_dict.values()}
print(rank_dict)
print(chile_len_set)
# {1: 'ghost', 2: 'habanero', 3: 'cayenne'}
# {8, 5, 7}


# Things to remember

# 1. List comprehensions are clearer than the map and filter built-in
#     functions because they don't require extra lambda expressions.
# 2. List comprehensions allow you easily skip items from the input list, a
#     behavior map doesn't support without help from filter.
# 3. Dictionaries and sets also support comprehension expressions.
